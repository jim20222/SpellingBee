# SpellingBee

Using an appropriate screen layout, design, implement and test a C# application to produce a game called Spelling Bee.
Each of the words included in the game will be related to a theme of the developerâ€™s choice. 

The game will come pre-loaded with enough words to commence the game.  
When the game begins a welcome screen will be displayed and the user will be given basic guidelines for the game.  
At this point there should be an option to start the game or enter more words.

When the game begins the program should choose the word at random from a bank of words.  

The user is invited to enter a guess and have it checked.   
Any letters that are guessed correctly should be indicated to the user.

The user can continue to enter guesses until the correct word is guessed when a suitable message should be displayed.  
The user should then be asked if they would like another word to be displayed.

If the user does not want to continue, the game ends.
